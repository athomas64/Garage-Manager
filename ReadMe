This program allows the user to manage a garage of vehicles. The user can add trucks and cars to their
garage. The user can also remove unwanted vehicles from their garage by entering the top speed of the vehicle they
want to remove. The garage then sorts the user's vehicles in order from slowest to fastest.

The Sortable interface allows the Car and Truck classes to be compared to each other in order to sort them in order
from fastest to slowest.

The Vehicle abstract class implements the Sortable interface's compareWith method. The Vehicle class serves as a base
class for the Truck class and Car class to extend from.

The Car and Truck class's both extend from the Vehicle class. The Car and Truck classes are the blueprints for the
objects that will be added to the user's garage. The Car and Truck classes both have a name and top speed variable
but override the toString method differently.

The GarageManager class saves a list of Vehicle objects that the user has in their garage. The GarageManager class
prompts the user for input and then according adds, removes or sorts vehicles. The GarageManager class uses an
Insertion Sort to sort the vehicles by top speed. The class uses a Binary Search to find a specific vehicle to be
removed.

The Main class is only included to hold the main(String[] args) method to start the program

The UnitTests class includes another main(String[] args) method runs a series of test cases on the program.
